# Wrap another PipeOp or Graph as a Hyperparameter

Wraps another
[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOp.md) or
[`Graph`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/Graph.md) as
determined by the `content` hyperparameter. Input is routed through the
`content` and the `content`s' output is returned. The `content`
hyperparameter can be changed during tuning, this is useful as an
alternative to
[`PipeOpBranch`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/mlr_pipeops_branch.md).

## Format

Abstract [`R6Class`](https://r6.r-lib.org/reference/R6Class.html)
inheriting from
[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOp.md).

## Construction

    PipeOpProxy$new(innum = 0, outnum = 1, id = "proxy", param_vals = list())

- `innum` ::
  `numeric(1)\cr Determines the number of input channels. If `innum\` is
  0 (default), a vararg input channel is created that can take an
  arbitrary number of inputs.

- `outnum` :: \`numeric(1)  
  Determines the number of output channels.

- `id` :: `character(1)`  
  Identifier of resulting object. See `$id` slot of
  [`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOp.md).

- `param_vals` :: named `list`  
  List of hyperparameter settings, overwriting the hyperparameter
  settings that would otherwise be set during construction. Default
  [`list()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html).

## Input and Output Channels

`PipeOpProxy` has multiple input channels depending on the `innum`
construction argument, named `"input1"`, `"input2"`, ... if `innum` is
nonzero; if `innum` is 0, there is only one *vararg* input channel named
`"..."`.

`PipeOpProxy` has multiple output channels depending on the `outnum`
construction argument, named `"output1"`, `"output2"`, ... The output is
determined by the output of the `content` operation (a
[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOp.md) or
[`Graph`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/Graph.md)).

## State

The `$state` is the trained `content`
[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOp.md) or
[`Graph`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/Graph.md).

## Parameters

- `content` ::
  [`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOp.md) \|
  [`Graph`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/Graph.md)  
  The [`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOp.md)
  or [`Graph`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/Graph.md)
  that is being proxied (or an object that is converted to a
  [`Graph`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/Graph.md) by
  [`as_graph()`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/as_graph.md)).
  Defaults to an instance of
  [`PipeOpFeatureUnion`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/mlr_pipeops_featureunion.md)
  (combines all input if they are
  [`Task`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Task.html)s).

## Internals

The `content` will internally be coerced to a graph via
[`as_graph()`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/as_graph.md)
prior to train and predict.

The default value for `content` is
[`PipeOpFeatureUnion`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/mlr_pipeops_featureunion.md),

## Fields

Fields inherited from
[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOp.md).

## Methods

Only methods inherited from
[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOp.md).
