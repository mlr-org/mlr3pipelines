# Conditional Target Value Impact Encoding

Encodes columns of type `factor`, `character` and `ordered`.

Impact coding for [classification
Tasks](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/TaskClassif.html) converts
factor levels of each (factorial) column to the difference between each
target level's conditional log-likelihood given this level, and the
target level's global log-likelihood.

Impact coding for [regression
Tasks](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/TaskRegr.html) converts factor
levels of each (factorial) column to the difference between the target's
conditional mean given this level, and the target's global mean.

Treats new levels during prediction like missing values.

## Format

[`R6Class`](https://r6.r-lib.org/reference/R6Class.html) object
inheriting from
[`PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple.md)/[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md)/[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOp.md).

## Construction

    PipeOpEncodeImpact$new(id = "encodeimpact", param_vals = list())

- `id` :: `character(1)`  
  Identifier of resulting object, default `"encodeimpact"`.

- `param_vals` :: named `list`  
  List of hyperparameter settings, overwriting the hyperparameter
  settings that would otherwise be set during construction. Default
  [`list()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html).

## Input and Output Channels

Input and output channels are inherited from
[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md).
Instead of a [`Task`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Task.html), a
[`TaskSupervised`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/TaskSupervised.html)
is used as input and output during training and prediction.

The output is the input
[`Task`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Task.html) with all affected
`factor`, `character` or `ordered` parameters encoded.

## State

The `$state` is a named `list` with the `$state` elements inherited from
[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md),
as well as:

- `impact` :: a named `list`  
  A list with an element for each affected feature:  
  For regression each element is a single column matrix of impact values
  for each level of that feature.  
  For classification, it is a list with an element for each *feature
  level*, which is a vector giving the impact of this feature level on
  each *outcome level*.

## Parameters

The parameters are the parameters inherited from
[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md),
as well as:

- `smoothing` :: `numeric(1)`  
  A finite positive value used for smoothing. Mostly relevant for
  [classification
  Tasks](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/TaskClassif.html) if a
  factor does not coincide with a target factor level (and would
  otherwise give an infinite logit value). Initialized to `1e-4`.

- `impute_zero` :: `logical(1)`  
  If `TRUE`, impute missing values as impact 0; otherwise the respective
  impact is coded as `NA`. Default `FALSE`.

## Internals

Uses Laplace smoothing, mostly to avoid infinite values for
[classification
Task](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/TaskClassif.html).

## Fields

Only fields inherited from
[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOp.md).

## Methods

Only methods inherited
[`PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple.md)/[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md)/[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOp.md).
