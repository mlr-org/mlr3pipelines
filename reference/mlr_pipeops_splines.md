# Transforms Numeric Features into Spline Basis Expansions

Replaces numeric features with columns representing spline basis
expansions.

Depending on the type parameter, constructs polynomial B-splines
[`splines::bs()`](https://rdrr.io/r/splines/bs.html) or natural cubic
splines [`splines::ns()`](https://rdrr.io/r/splines/ns.html) for the
respective column.

## Format

[`R6Class`](https://r6.r-lib.org/reference/R6Class.html) object
inheriting from
[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md)/[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOp.md).

## Construction

    po("splines", param_vals = list())

- `id` :: `character(1)`  
  Identifier of resulting object, default `"splines"`.

- `param_vals` :: named `list`  
  List of hyperparameter settings, overwriting the hyperparameter
  settings that would otherwise be set during construction. Default
  [`list()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html).

## Input and Output Channels

Input and output channels are inherited from
[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md).

The output is the input
[`Task`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Task.html) with the selected
columns transformed according to the specified Splines Method.

## State

The `$state` is a named `list` with the `$state` elements inherited from
[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md).
After training the `Boundary.knots` will be given to the `$state`.

## Parameters

The parameters are the parameters inherited from
[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md),
as well as:

- `type` :: `character(1)`  
  Controls the type of splines that are to be created. Can be either
  `polynomial` ([`splines::bs`](https://rdrr.io/r/splines/bs.html)) or
  `natural` ([`splines::ns`](https://rdrr.io/r/splines/ns.html)).
  Initializied to `"natural"`.

- `df` :: `integer(1)`  
  Number of degrees of freedom for calculation of the spline basis
  matrix. Initialized to `NULL`. Depending on `type`, see either
  [`splines::bs()`](https://rdrr.io/r/splines/bs.html) or
  [`splines::ns()`](https://rdrr.io/r/splines/ns.html).

- `knots` :: named `list`  
  Internal breakpoints that define the spline, given as a named list of
  numeric vectors, where each name corresponds to a feature and its
  value specifies the knots for that feature. Default is `NULL`.
  Depending on `type`, see either
  [`splines::bs()`](https://rdrr.io/r/splines/bs.html) or
  [`splines::ns()`](https://rdrr.io/r/splines/ns.html).

- `intercept` :: `logical(1)`  
  If `TRUE`, an intercept is included in the basis. Default is `FALSE`.
  Depending on `type`, see either
  [`splines::bs()`](https://rdrr.io/r/splines/bs.html) or
  [`splines::ns()`](https://rdrr.io/r/splines/ns.html).

- `degree` :: `integer(1)`  
  Degree of the polynomial used to compute polynomial splines. Only used
  if `type` is `"polynomial"`. Default is `3`. See
  [`splines::bs()`](https://rdrr.io/r/splines/bs.html).

- `Boundary.knots` :: named `list`  
  Boundary points at which to anchor the spline basis, given as a named
  list of numeric vectors, where each name corresponds to a feature and
  its value specifies the boundary points for that feature. Default is
  `NULL`. Depending on `type`, see either
  [`splines::bs()`](https://rdrr.io/r/splines/bs.html) or
  [`splines::ns()`](https://rdrr.io/r/splines/ns.html).

## Internals

Creates a spline basis using either
[`splines::bs`](https://rdrr.io/r/splines/bs.html) or
[`splines::ns`](https://rdrr.io/r/splines/ns.html) depending on the
hyperparameter `type`. After training, the `Boundary.knots` that were
either provided by the user or calculated during training are stored in
the `PipeOp`'s `$state`.

## Fields

Only fields inherited from
[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOp.md).

## Methods

Only methods inherited from
[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md)/[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOp.md).
