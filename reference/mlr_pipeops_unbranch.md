# Unbranch Different Paths

Used to bring together different paths created by
[`PipeOpBranch`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/mlr_pipeops_branch.md).

## Format

[`R6Class`](https://r6.r-lib.org/reference/R6Class.html) object
inheriting from
[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOp.md).

## Construction

    PipeOpUnbranch$new(options, id = "unbranch", param_vals = list())

- `options` :: `numeric(1)` \| `character`  
  If `options` is 0, a vararg input channel is created that can take any
  number of inputs. If `options` is a nonzero integer number, it
  determines the number of input channels / options that are created,
  named `input1`...`input<n>`. The If `options` is a `character`, it
  determines the names of channels directly. The difference between
  these three is purely cosmetic if the user chooses to produce channel
  names matching with the corresponding
  [`PipeOpBranch`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/mlr_pipeops_branch.md).
  However, it is not necessary to have matching names and the *vararg*
  option is always viable.

- `id` :: `character(1)`  
  Identifier of resulting object, default `"unbranch"`.

- `param_vals` :: named `list`  
  List of hyperparameter settings, overwriting the hyperparameter
  settings that would otherwise be set during construction. Default
  [`list()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html).

## Input and Output

`PipeOpUnbranch` has multiple input channels depending on the `options`
construction argument, named `"input1"`, `"input2"`, ... if `options` is
a nonzero integer and named after each `options` value if `options` is a
`character`; if `options` is 0, there is only one *vararg* input channel
named `"..."`. All input channels take any argument (`"*"`) both during
training and prediction.

`PipeOpUnbranch` has one output channel named `"output"`, producing the
only [`NO_OP`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/NO_OP.md)
object received as input (`"*"`), both during training and prediction.

## State

The `$state` is left empty
([`list()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html)).

## Parameters

`PipeOpUnbranch` has no parameters.

## Internals
