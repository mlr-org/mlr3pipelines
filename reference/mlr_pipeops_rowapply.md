# Apply a Function to each Row of a Task

Applies a function to each row of a task. Use the `affect_columns`
parameter inherited from
[`PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple.md)
to limit the columns this function should be applied to.

## Format

[`R6Class`](https://r6.r-lib.org/reference/R6Class.html) object
inheriting from
[`PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple.md)/[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md)/[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOp.md).

## Construction

    PipeOpColApply$new(id = "rowapply", param_vals = list())

- `id` :: `character(1)`  
  Identifier of resulting object, default `"rowapply"`.

- `param_vals` :: named `list`  
  List of hyperparameter settings, overwriting the hyperparameter
  settings that would otherwise be set during construction. Default
  [`list()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html).

## Input and Output Channels

Input and output channels are inherited from
[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md).

The output is the input
[`Task`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Task.html) with the original
affected columns replaced by the columns created by applying
`applicator` to each row.

## State

The `$state` is a named `list` with the `$state` elements inherited from
[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md).

## Parameters

The parameters are the parameters inherited from
[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md),
as well as:

- `applicator` :: `function`  
  Function to apply to each row in the affected columns of the task. The
  return value should be a vector of the same length for every input.
  Initialized as [`identity()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/identity.html).

- `col_prefix` :: `character(1)`  
  If specified, prefix to be prepended to the column names of affected
  columns, separated by a dot (`.`). Initialized as `""`.

## Internals

Calls [`apply`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/apply.html) on the data, using
the value of `applicator` as `FUN`.

## Fields

Only fields inherited from
[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOp.md).

## Methods

Only methods inherited from
[`PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple.md)/[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md)/[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOp.md).
