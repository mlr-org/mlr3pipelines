# Piecewise Linear Encoding Base Class

Abstract base class for piecewise linear encoding.

Piecewise linear encoding works by splitting values of features into
distinct bins, through an algorithm implemented in
`private$.get_bins()`, and then creating new feature columns through a
continuous alternative to one-hot encoding. Here, one new feature per
bin is constructed, with values being either

- `0`, if the original value was below the lower bin boundary,

- `1`, if the original value was above or equal to the upper bin
  boundary, or

- a scaled value between `0` and `1`, if the original value was inside
  the bin boundaries. Scaling is done by offsetting the original value
  by the lower bin boundary and dividing by the bin width.

[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOp.md)s
inheriting from this encode columns of type `numeric` and `integer`. Use
the
[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md)
`$affect_columns` functionality to only encode a subset of columns, or
only encode columns of a certain type, etc.

## Format

Abstract [`R6Class`](https://r6.r-lib.org/reference/R6Class.html) object
inheriting from
[`PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple.md)/[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md)/[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOp.md).

## Construction

    PipeOpEncodePL$new(id = "encodepl", param_set = ps(), param_vals = list(), packages = character(0), task_type = "Task")

- `id` :: `character(1)`  
  Identifier of resulting object. See `$id` slot of
  [`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOp.md).

- `param_set` ::
  [`ParamSet`](https://paradox.mlr-org.com/reference/ParamSet.html)  
  Parameter space description. This should be created by the subclass
  and given to `super$initialize()`.

- `param_vals` :: named `list`  
  List of hyperparameter settings, overwriting the hyperparameter
  settings given in `param_set`. The subclass should have its own
  `param_vals` parameter and pass it on to `super$initialize()`. Default
  [`list()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html).

- `packages` :: `character`  
  Set of all required packages for the
  [`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOp.md)'s
  `private$.train()` and `private$.predict()` methods. See `$packages`
  slot. Default is `character(0)`.

- `task_type` :: `character(1)`  
  The class of [`Task`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Task.html)
  that should be accepted as input and will be returned as output. This
  should generally be a `character(1)` identifying a type of
  [`Task`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Task.html), e.g. `"Task"`,
  `"TaskClassif"` or `"TaskRegr"` (or another subclass introduced by
  other packages). Default is `"Task"`.

## Input and Output Channels

Input and output channels are inherited from
[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md).

The output is the input
[`Task`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Task.html) with all affected
`numeric` and `integer` columns encoded using piecewise linear encoding.

## State

The `$state` is a named `list` with the `$state` elements inherited from
[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md),
as well as:

- `bins` :: named `list`  
  Named list of numeric vectors. Each element corresponds to and is
  named after one of the affected feature columns and contains the bin
  boundaries derived through `private$.get_bins()`.

## Parameters

The parameters are the parameters inherited from
[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md).

## Internals

`PipeOpEncodePL` is an abstract class inheriting from
[`PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple.md)
that allows easier implementation of different binning algorithms for
piecewise linear encoding. The respective binning algorithm should be
implemented as `private$.get_bins()`.

## Fields

Only fields inherited from
[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOp.md).

## Methods

Methods inherited from
[`PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple.md)/[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md)/[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOp.md)
as well as

- `.get_bins(task, cols)`  
  ([`Task`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Task.html), `character`)
  -\> named `list`  
  Abstract method for splitting the value range of a feature column into
  distinct bins. The argument `cols` should give the names of the
  feature columns of the `task` for which bins should be derived.
  Returns a named list of numeric vectors containing the bin boundaries
  for each affected feature column, named by that corresponding feature
  column.
