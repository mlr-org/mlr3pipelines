# Customizable Information Printer

`PipeOpInfo` prints its input to the console or a logger in a
customizable way. Users can define how specific object classes should be
displayed using custom printer functions.

## Format

[`R6Class`](https://r6.r-lib.org/reference/R6Class.html) object
inheriting from
[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOp.md)

## Construction

    PipeOpInfo$new(id = "info", collect_multiplicity = FALSE, log_target = "lgr::mlr3/mlr3pipelines::info")

- `id` :: `character(1)`  
  Identifier of resulting object, default "info"

- `printer` :: `list`  
  Optional mapping from object classes to printer functions. Custom
  functions override default printer-functions.

- `collect_multiplicity` :: `logical(1)`  
  If `TRUE`, the input is a
  [`Multiplicity`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/Multiplicity.md)
  collecting channel.
  [`Multiplicity`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/Multiplicity.md)
  input/output is accepted and the members are aggregated.

- `log_target` :: `character(1)`  
  Specifies how the input object is printed to the console. By default
  it is directed to a logger, whose address can be customized using the
  form `<output>::<argument1>::<argument2>`. Otherwise it can be printed
  as "message", "warning" or "cat". When set to "none", no customized
  information about the object will be printed.

## Input and Output Channels

`PipeOpInfo` has one input channel called "input", it can take any type
of input (`*`). `PipeOpInfo` has one output channel called "output", it
can take any type of output (`*`).

## State

The `$state` is left empty
([`list()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html)).

## Internals

`PipeOpInfo` forwards its input unchanged, but prints information about
it depending on the `printer` and `log_target` settings.

## Fields

Fields inherited from `PipeOp`, as well as:

- `printer` :: `list`  
  Mapping of object classes to printer functions. Includes
  printer-specifications for `Task`, `Prediction`, `NULL`. Otherwise
  object is printed as is.

- `log_target` :: `character(1)`  
  Specifies current output target.

## Methods

Only methods inherited from
[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOp.md).
