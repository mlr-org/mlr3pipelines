# Impute Features by Sampling

Impute features by sampling from non-missing training data.

## Format

[`R6Class`](https://r6.r-lib.org/reference/R6Class.html) object
inheriting from
[`PipeOpImpute`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOpImpute.md)/[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOp.md).

## Construction

    PipeOpImputeSample$new(id = "imputesample", param_vals = list())

- `id` :: `character(1)`  
  Identifier of resulting object, default `"imputesample"`.

- `param_vals` :: named `list`  
  List of hyperparameter settings, overwriting the hyperparameter
  settings that would otherwise be set during construction. Default
  [`list()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html).

## Input and Output Channels

Input and output channels are inherited from
[`PipeOpImpute`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOpImpute.md).

The output is the input
[`Task`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Task.html) with all affected
numeric features missing values imputed by values sampled (column-wise)
from training data.

## State

The `$state` is a named `list` with the `$state` elements inherited from
[`PipeOpImpute`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOpImpute.md).

The `$state$model` is a named `list` of training data with missings
removed.

## Parameters

The parameters are the parameters inherited from
[`PipeOpImpute`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOpImpute.md).

## Internals

Uses the [`sample()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/sample.html) function.
Features that are entirely `NA` are imputed as the following: For
`factor` or `ordered`, random levels are sampled uniformly at random.
For logicals, `TRUE` or `FALSE` are sampled uniformly at random.
Numerics and integers are imputed as `0`.

## Fields

Only fields inherited from
[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOp.md).

## Methods

Only methods inherited from
[`PipeOpImpute`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOpImpute.md)/[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOp.md).
