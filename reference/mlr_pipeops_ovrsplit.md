# Split a Classification Task into Binary Classification Tasks

Splits a [classification
Task](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/TaskClassif.html) into several
binary [classification
Tasks](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/TaskClassif.html) to perform
"One vs. Rest" classification. This works in combination with
[`PipeOpOVRUnite`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/mlr_pipeops_ovrunite.md).

For each target level a new binary [classification
Task](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/TaskClassif.html) is
constructed with the respective target level being the positive class
and all other target levels being the new negative class `"rest"`.

This [`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOp.md)
creates a
[`Multiplicity`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/Multiplicity.md),
which means that subsequent
[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOp.md)s are
executed multiple times, once for each created [binary
Task](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/TaskClassif.html), until a
[`PipeOpOVRUnite`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/mlr_pipeops_ovrunite.md)
is reached.

Note that
[`Multiplicity`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/Multiplicity.md)
is currently an experimental features and the implementation or UI may
change.

## Format

[`R6Class`](https://r6.r-lib.org/reference/R6Class.html) inheriting from
[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOp.md).

## Construction

    PipeOpOVRSplit$new(id = "ovrsplit", param_vals = list())

- `id` :: `character(1)`  
  Identifier of the resulting object, default `"ovrsplit"`.

- `param_vals` :: named `list`  
  List of hyperparameter settings, overwriting the hyperparameter
  settings that would otherwise be set during construction. Default
  [`list()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html).

## Input and Output Channels

`PipeOpOVRSplit` has one input channel named `"input"` taking a
[`TaskClassif`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/TaskClassif.html)
both during training and prediction.

`PipeOpOVRSplit` has one output channel named `"output"` returning a
[`Multiplicity`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/Multiplicity.md)
of [`TaskClassif`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/TaskClassif.html)s
both during training and prediction, i.e., the newly constructed binary
[classification
Tasks](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/TaskClassif.html).

## State

The `$state` contains the original target levels of the
[`TaskClassif`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/TaskClassif.html)
supplied during training.

## Parameters

`PipeOpOVRSplit` has no parameters.

## Internals

The original target levels stored in the `$state` are also used during
prediction when creating the new binary [classification
Tasks](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/TaskClassif.html).

The names of the element of the output
[`Multiplicity`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/Multiplicity.md)
are given by the levels of the target.

If a target level `"rest"` is present in the input
[`TaskClassif`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/TaskClassif.html),
the negative class will be labeled as `"rest." (using as many `"."\`
postfixes needed to yield a valid label).

Should be used in combination with
[`PipeOpOVRUnite`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/mlr_pipeops_ovrunite.md).

## Fields

Only fields inherited from
[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOp.md).

## Methods

Only methods inherited from
[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOp.md).
