# Add Missing Indicator Columns

Add missing indicator columns ("dummy columns") to the
[`Task`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Task.html). Drops original
features; should probably be used in combination with
[`PipeOpFeatureUnion`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/mlr_pipeops_featureunion.md)
and imputation
[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOp.md)s (see
examples).

Note the `affect_columns` is initialized with
`selector_invert(selector_type(c("factor", "ordered", "character")))`,
since missing values in factorial columns are often indicated by
out-of-range imputation
([`PipeOpImputeOOR`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/mlr_pipeops_imputeoor.md)).

## Format

[`R6Class`](https://r6.r-lib.org/reference/R6Class.html) object
inheriting from
[`PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple.md)/[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md)/[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOp.md).

## Construction

    PipeOpMissInd$new(id = "missind", param_vals = list())

- `id` :: `character(1)` Identifier of the resulting object, defaulting
  to `"missind"`.

- `param_vals` :: named `list`  
  List of hyperparameter settings, overwriting the hyperparameter
  settings that would otherwise be set during construction. Default
  [`list()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html).

## State

`$state` is a named `list` with the `$state` elements inherited from
[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md),
as well as:

- `indicand_cols` :: `character`  
  Names of columns for which indicator columns are added. If the `which`
  parameter is `"all"`, this is just the names of all features,
  otherwise it is the names of all features that had missing values
  during training.

## Parameters

The parameters are the parameters inherited from the
[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md),
as well as:

- `which` :: `character(1)`  
  Determines for which features the indicator columns are added. Can
  either be `"missing_train"` (default), adding indicator columns for
  each feature that actually has missing values, or `"all"`, adding
  indicator columns for all features.

- `type` :: `character(1)`  
  Determines the type of the newly created columns. Can be one of
  `"factor"` (default), `"integer"`, `"logical"`, `"numeric"`.

## Internals

This [`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOp.md)
should cover most cases where "dummy columns" or "missing indicators"
are desired. Some edge cases:

- If imputation for factorial features is performed and only numeric
  features should gain missing indicators, the `affect_columns`
  parameter can be set to `selector_type("numeric")`.

- If missing indicators should only be added for features that have more
  than a fraction of `x` missing values, the
  [`PipeOpRemoveConstants`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/mlr_pipeops_removeconstants.md)
  can be used with `affect_columns = selector_grep("^missing_")` and
  `ratio = x`.
