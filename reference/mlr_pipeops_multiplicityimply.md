# Implicate a Multiplicity

Implicate a
[`Multiplicity`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/Multiplicity.md)
by returning the input(s) converted to a
[`Multiplicity`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/Multiplicity.md).

This [`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOp.md)
has multiple input channels; all inputs are collected into a
[`Multiplicity`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/Multiplicity.md)
and then are forwarded along a single edge, causing the following
[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOp.md)s to be
called multiple times, once for each
[`Multiplicity`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/Multiplicity.md)
member.

Note that
[`Multiplicity`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/Multiplicity.md)
is currently an experimental features and the implementation or UI may
change.

## Format

[`R6Class`](https://r6.r-lib.org/reference/R6Class.html) object
inheriting from
[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/PipeOp.md).

## Construction

    PipeOpMultiplicityImply$new(innum = 0, id = "multiplicityimply", param_vals = list())

- `innum` :: `numeric(1)` \| `character`  
  Determines the number of input channels. If `innum` is 0 (default), a
  vararg input channel is created that can take an arbitrary number of
  inputs. If `innum` is a `character` vector, the number of input
  channels is the length of `innum`.

- `id` :: `character(1)`  
  Identifier of the resulting object, default `"multiplicityimply"`.

- `param_vals` :: named `list`  
  List of hyperparameter settings, overwriting the hyperparameter
  settings that would otherwise be set during construction. Default
  [`list()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html).

## Input and Output Channels

`PipeOpMultiplicityImply` has multiple input channels depending on the
`innum` construction argument, named `"input1"`, `"input2"`, ... if
`innum` is nonzero; if `innum` is 0, there is only one *vararg* input
channel named `"..."`. All input channels take any input (`"*"`) both
during training and prediction.

`PipeOpMultiplicityImply` has one output channel named `"output"`,
emitting a
[`Multiplicity`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/Multiplicity.md)
of type any (`"[*]"`), i.e., returning the input(s) converted to a
[`Multiplicity`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/Multiplicity.md)
both during training and prediction.

## State

The `$state` is left empty
([`list()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html)).

## Parameters

`PipeOpMultiplicityImply` has no Parameters.

## Internals

If `innum` is not `numeric`, e.g., a `character`, the output
[`Multiplicity`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/reference/Multiplicity.md)
will be named based on the input channel names

## Fields
