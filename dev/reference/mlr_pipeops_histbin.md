# Split Numeric Features into Equally Spaced Bins

Splits numeric features into equally spaced bins. See
[`graphics::hist()`](https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/hist.html) for details.
Values that fall out of the training data range during prediction are
binned with the lowest / highest bin respectively.

## Format

[`R6Class`](https://r6.r-lib.org/reference/R6Class.html) object
inheriting from
[`PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple.md)/[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md)/[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOp.md).

## Construction

    PipeOpHistBin$new(id = "histbin", param_vals = list())

- `id` :: `character(1)`  
  Identifier of resulting object, default `"histbin"`.

- `param_vals` :: named `list`  
  List of hyperparameter settings, overwriting the hyperparameter
  settings that would otherwise be set during construction. Default
  [`list()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html).

## Input and Output Channels

Input and output channels are inherited from
[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md).

The output is the input
[`Task`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Task.html) with all affected
numeric features replaced by their binned versions.

## State

The `$state` is a named `list` with the `$state` elements inherited from
[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md),
as well as:

- `breaks` :: `list`  
  List of intervals representing the bins for each numeric feature.

## Parameters

The parameters are the parameters inherited from
[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md),
as well as:

- `breaks` :: `character(1)` \| `numeric` \| `function`  
  Either a `character(1)` string naming an algorithm to compute the
  number of cells, a `numeric(1)` giving the number of breaks for the
  histogram, a vector `numeric` giving the breakpoints between the
  histogram cells, or a `function` to compute the vector of breakpoints
  or to compute the number of cells. Default is algorithm `"Sturges"`
  (see
  [`grDevices::nclass.Sturges()`](https://rdrr.io/r/grDevices/nclass.html)).
  For details see [`hist()`](https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/hist.html).

## Internals

Uses the [`graphics::hist`](https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/hist.html)
function.

## Fields

Only fields inherited from
[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOp.md).

## Methods

Only methods inherited from
[`PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple.md)/[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md)/[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOp.md).
