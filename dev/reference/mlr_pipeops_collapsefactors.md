# Collapse Factors

Collapses factors of type `factor`, `ordered`: Collapses the rarest
factors in the training samples, until `target_level_count` levels
remain. Levels that have prevalence strictly above
`no_collapse_above_prevalence` or absolute count strictly above
`no_collapse_above_absolute` are retained, however. For `factor`
variables, these are collapsed to the next larger level, for `ordered`
variables, rare variables are collapsed to the neighbouring class,
whichever has fewer samples. In case both `no_collapse_above_prevalence`
and `no_collapse_above_absolute` are given, the less strict threshold of
the two will be used, i.e. if `no_collapse_above_prevalence` is 1 and
`no_collapse_above_absolute` is 10 for a task with 100 samples, levels
that are seen more than 10 times will not be collapsed.

Levels not seen during training are not touched during prediction;
Therefore it is useful to combine this with the
[`PipeOpFixFactors`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/mlr_pipeops_fixfactors.md).

## Format

[`R6Class`](https://r6.r-lib.org/reference/R6Class.html) object
inheriting from
[`PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple.md)/[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md)/[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOp.md).

## Construction

    PipeOpCollapseFactors$new(id = "collapsefactors", param_vals = list())

- `id` :: `character(1)`  
  Identifier of resulting object, default `"collapsefactors"`.

- `param_vals` :: named `list`  
  List of hyperparameter settings, overwriting the hyperparameter
  settings that would otherwise be set during construction. Default
  [`list()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html).

## Input and Output Channels

Input and output channels are inherited from
[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md).

The output is the input
[`Task`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Task.html) with rare
affected `factor` and `ordered` feature levels collapsed.

## State

The `$state` is a named `list` with the `$state` elements inherited from
[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md),
as well as:

- `collapse_map` :: named `list` of named `list` of `character`  
  List of factor level maps. For each factor, `collapse_map` contains a
  named `list` that indicates what levels of the input task get mapped
  to what levels of the output task. If `collapse_map` has an entry
  `feat_1` with an entry `a = c("x", "y")`, it means that levels `"x"`
  and `"y"` get collapsed to level `"a"` in feature `"feat_1"`.

## Parameters

The parameters are the parameters inherited from
[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md),
as well as:

- `no_collapse_above_prevalence` :: `numeric(1)`  
  Fraction of samples below which factor levels get collapsed. Default
  is 1, which causes all levels to be collapsed until
  `target_level_count` remain.

- `no_collapse_above_absolute` :: `integer(1)`  
  Number of samples below which factor levels get collapsed. Default is
  `Inf`, which causes all levels to be collapsed until
  `target_level_count` remain.

- `target_level_count` :: `integer(1)`  
  Number of levels to retain. Default is 2.

## Internals

Makes use of the fact that
`levels(fact_var) = list(target1 = c("source1", "source2"), target2 = "source2")`
causes renaming of level `"source1"` and `"source2"` both to
`"target1"`, and also `"source2"` to `"target2"`.

## Fields

Only fields inherited from
[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOp.md).

## Methods
