# Impute Numerical Features by Histogram

Impute numerical features by histogram.

During training, a histogram is fitted on each column using R's
[`hist()`](https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/hist.html) function. The fitted
histogram is then sampled from for imputation. Sampling happens in a
two-step process: First, a bin is sampled from the histogram, then a
value is sampled uniformly from the bin. This is an approximation to
sampling from the empirical training data distribution (i.e. sampling
from training data with replacement), but is much more memory efficient
for large datasets, since the `$state` does not need to save the
training data.

## Format

[`R6Class`](https://r6.r-lib.org/reference/R6Class.html) object
inheriting from
[`PipeOpImpute`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpImpute.md)/[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOp.md).

## Construction

    PipeOpImputeHist$new(id = "imputehist", param_vals = list())

- `id` :: `character(1)`  
  Identifier of resulting object, default `"imputehist"`.

- `param_vals` :: named `list`  
  List of hyperparameter settings, overwriting the hyperparameter
  settings that would otherwise be set during construction. Default
  [`list()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html).

## Input and Output Channels

Input and output channels are inherited from
[`PipeOpImpute`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpImpute.md).

The output is the input
[`Task`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Task.html) with all affected
numeric features missing values imputed by (column-wise) histogram; see
Description for details.

## State

The `$state` is a named `list` with the `$state` elements inherited from
[`PipeOpImpute`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpImpute.md).

The `$state$model` is a named `list` of `list`s containing elements
`$counts` and `$breaks`.

## Parameters

The parameters are the parameters inherited from
[`PipeOpImpute`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpImpute.md).

## Internals

Uses the [`graphics::hist()`](https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/hist.html)
function. Features that are entirely `NA` are imputed as `0`.

## Fields

Only fields inherited from
[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOp.md).

## Methods

Only methods inherited from
[`PipeOpImpute`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpImpute.md)/[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOp.md).
