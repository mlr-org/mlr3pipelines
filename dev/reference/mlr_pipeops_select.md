# Remove Features Depending on a Selector

Removes features from
[`Task`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Task.html) depending on a
[`Selector`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/Selector.md)
function: The `selector` parameter gives the features to keep. See
[`Selector`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/Selector.md)
for selectors that are provided and how to write custom
[`Selector`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/Selector.md)s.

## Format

[`R6Class`](https://r6.r-lib.org/reference/R6Class.html) object
inheriting from
[`PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple.md)/[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md)/[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOp.md).

## Construction

    PipeOpSelect$new(id = "select", param_vals = list())

- `id` :: `character(1)`  
  Identifier of resulting object, default `"select"`.

- `param_vals` :: named `list`  
  List of hyperparameter settings, overwriting the hyperparameter
  settings that would otherwise be set during construction. Default
  [`list()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html).

## Input and Output Channels

Input and output channels are inherited from
[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md).

The output is the input
[`Task`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Task.html) with features
removed that were not selected by the
[`Selector`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/Selector.md)/`function`
in `selector`.

## State

The `$state` is a named `list` with the `$state` elements inherited from
[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md),
as well as:

- `selection` :: `character`  
  A vector of all feature names that are kept (i.e. not dropped) in the
  [`Task`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Task.html). Initialized to
  [`selector_all()`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/Selector.md)

## Parameters

The parameters are the parameters inherited from
[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md),
as well as:

- `selector` :: `function` \|
  [`Selector`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/Selector.md)  
  [`Selector`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/Selector.md)
  function, takes a `Task` as argument and returns a `character` of
  features to keep.  
  See
  [`Selector`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/Selector.md)
  for example functions. Defaults to
  [`selector_all()`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/Selector.md).

## Internals

Uses `task$select()`.

## Fields

Only fields inherited from
[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOp.md).

## Methods

Only methods inherited from
[`PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple.md)/[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md)/[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOp.md).
