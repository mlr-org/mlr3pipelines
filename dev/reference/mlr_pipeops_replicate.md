# Replicate the Input as a Multiplicity

Replicate the input as a
[`Multiplicity`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/Multiplicity.md),
causing subsequent
[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOp.md)s
to be executed multiple `reps` times.

Note that
[`Multiplicity`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/Multiplicity.md)
is currently an experimental features and the implementation or UI may
change.

## Format

[`R6Class`](https://r6.r-lib.org/reference/R6Class.html) object
inheriting from
[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOp.md).

## Construction

    PipeOpReplicate$new(id = "replicate", param_vals = list())

- `id` :: `character(1)` Identifier of the resulting object, default
  `"replicate"`.

- `param_vals` :: named `list`  
  List of hyperparameter settings, overwriting the hyperparameter
  settings that would otherwise be set during construction. Default
  [`list()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html).

## Input and Output Channels

`PipeOpReplicate` has one input channel named `"input"`, taking any
input (`"*"`) both during training and prediction.

`PipeOpReplicate` has one output channel named `"output"` returning the
replicated input as a
[`Multiplicity`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/Multiplicity.md)
of type any (`"[*]"`) both during training and prediction.

## State

The `$state` is left empty
([`list()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html)).

## Parameters

- `reps` :: `numeric(1)`  
  Integer indicating the number of times the input should be replicated.

## Fields

Only fields inherited from
[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOp.md).

## Methods

Only methods inherited from
[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOp.md).
