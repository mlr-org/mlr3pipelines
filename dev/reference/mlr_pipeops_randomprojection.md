# Project Numeric Features onto a Randomly Sampled Subspace

Projects numeric features onto a randomly sampled subspace. All numeric
features (or the ones selected by `affect_columns`) are replaced by
numeric features `PR1`, `PR2`, ... `PRn`

Samples with features that contain missing values result in all
`PR1`..`PRn` being NA for that sample, so it is advised to do imputation
*before* random projections if missing values can be expected.

## Format

[`R6Class`](https://r6.r-lib.org/reference/R6Class.html) object
inheriting from
[`PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple.md)/[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md)/[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOp.md).

## Construction

    PipeOpRandomProjection$new(id = "randomprojection", param_vals = list())

- `id` :: `character(1)`  
  Identifier of resulting object, default `"randomprojection"`.

- `param_vals` :: named `list`  
  List of hyperparameter settings, overwriting the hyperparameter
  settings that would otherwise be set during construction. Default
  [`list()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html).

## Input and Output Channels

Input and output channels are inherited from
[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md).

The output is the input
[`Task`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Task.html) with affected
numeric features projected onto a random subspace.

## State

The `$state` is a named `list` with the `$state` elements inherited from
[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md),
as well as an element `$projection`, a `matrix`.

## Parameters

The parameters are the parameters inherited from
[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md),
as well as:

- `rank` :: `integer(1)`  
  The dimension of the subspace to project onto. Initialized to 1.

## Internals

If there are `n` (affected) numeric features in the input
[`Task`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Task.html), then
`$state$projection` is a `rank` x `m` `matrix`. The output is calculated
as `input %*% state$projection`.

The random projection matrix is obtained through Gram-Schmidt
orthogonalization from a matrix with values standard normally
distributed, which gives a distribution that is rotation invariant, as
per Eaton: Multivariate Statistics, A Vector Space Approach, Pg. 234.

## Fields

Only fields inherited from
[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOp.md).
