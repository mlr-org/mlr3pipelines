# Change Column Roles of a Task

Changes the column roles of the input
[`Task`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Task.html) according to
`new_role` or its inverse `new_role_direct`.

Setting a new target variable or changing the role of an existing target
variable is not supported.

## Format

[`R6Class`](https://r6.r-lib.org/reference/R6Class.html) object
inheriting from
[`PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple.md)/[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md)/[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOp.md).

## Construction

    PipeOpColRoles$new(id = "colroles", param_vals = list())

- `id` :: `character(1)`  
  Identifier of resulting object, default `"colroles"`.

- `param_vals` :: named `list`  
  List of hyperparameter settings, overwriting the hyperparameter
  settings that would otherwise be set during construction. Default
  [`list()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html).

## Input and Output Channels

Input and output channels are inherited from
[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md).

The output is the input
[`Task`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Task.html) with transformed
column roles according to `new_role` or its inverse `new_role_direct`.

## State

The `$state` is a named `list` with the `$state` elements inherited from
[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md).

## Parameters

The parameters are the parameters inherited from
[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md),
as well as:

- `new_role` :: named `list`  
  Named list of new column roles by column. The names must match the
  column names of the input task that will later be trained/predicted
  on. Each entry of the list must contain a character vector with
  possible values of
  [`mlr_reflections$task_col_roles`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/mlr_reflections.html).
  If the value is given as
  [`character()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/character.html) or `NULL`, the
  column will be dropped from the input task. Changing the role of a
  column results in this column loosing its previous role(s).

- `new_role_direct` :: named `list`  
  \# Named list of new column roles by role. The names must match the
  possible column roles, i.e. values of
  [`mlr_reflections$task_col_roles`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/mlr_reflections.html).
  Each entry of the list must contain a character vector with column
  names of the input task that will later be trained/predicted on. If
  the value is given as
  [`character()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/character.html) or `NULL`, all
  columns will be dropped from the role given in the element name. The
  value given for a role overwrites the previous entry in
  `task$col_roles` for that role, completely.

## Fields

Only fields inherited from
[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOp.md).

## Methods

Only methods inherited from
[`PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple.md)/[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md)/[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOp.md).
