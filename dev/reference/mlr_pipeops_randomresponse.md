# Generate a Randomized Response Prediction

Takes in a
[`Prediction`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Prediction.html) of
`predict_type` `"prob"` (for
[`PredictionClassif`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/PredictionClassif.html))
or `"se"` (for
[`PredictionRegr`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/PredictionRegr.html))
and generates a randomized `"response"` prediction.

For `"prob"`, the responses are sampled according to the probabilities
of the input
[`PredictionClassif`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/PredictionClassif.html).
For `"se"`, responses are randomly drawn according to the `rdistfun`
parameter (default is [`rnorm`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/Normal.html)) by
using the original responses of the input
[`PredictionRegr`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/PredictionRegr.html)
as the mean and the original standard errors of the input
[`PredictionRegr`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/PredictionRegr.html)
as the standard deviation (sampling is done observation-wise).

## Format

[`R6Class`](https://r6.r-lib.org/reference/R6Class.html) object
inheriting from
[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOp.md).

## Construction

    PipeOpRandomResponse$new(id = "randomresponse", param_vals = list(), packages = character(0))

- `id` :: `character(1)`  
  Identifier of the resulting object, default `"randomresponse"`.

- `param_vals` :: named `list`  
  List of hyperparameter settings, overwriting the hyperparameter
  settings that would otherwise be set during construction. Default
  [`list()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html).

- packages :: `character`  
  Set of all required packages for the `private$.predict()` methods
  related to the `rdistfun` parameter. Default is `character(0)`.

## Input and Output Channels

`PipeOpRandomResponse` has one input channel named `"input"`, taking
`NULL` during training and a
[`Prediction`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Prediction.html)
during prediction.

`PipeOpRandomResponse` has one output channel named `"output"`,
producing `NULL` during training and a
[`Prediction`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Prediction.html) with
random responses during prediction.

## State

The `$state` is left empty
([`list()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html)).

## Parameters

- `rdistfun` :: `function`  
  A function for generating random responses when the predict type is
  `"se"`. This function must accept the arguments `n` (integerish number
  of responses), `mean` (`numeric` for the mean), and `sd` (`numeric`
  for the standard deviation), and must *vectorize* over `mean` and
  `sd`. Default is [`rnorm`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/Normal.html).

## Internals

If the `predict_type` of the input
[`Prediction`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Prediction.html) does
not match `"prob"` or `"se"`, the input
[`Prediction`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Prediction.html) will
be returned unaltered.
