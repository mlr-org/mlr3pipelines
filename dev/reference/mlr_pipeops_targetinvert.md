# Invert Target Transformations

Inverts target-transformations done during training based on a supplied
inversion function. Typically should be used in combination with a
subclass of
[`PipeOpTargetTrafo`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTargetTrafo.md).

During prediction phase the function supplied through `"fun"` is called
with a `list` containing the `"prediction"` as a single element, and
should return a `list` with a single element (a
[`Prediction`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Prediction.html)) that
is returned by `PipeOpTargetInvert`.

## Format

[`R6Class`](https://r6.r-lib.org/reference/R6Class.html) object
inheriting from
[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOp.md).

## Construction

    PipeOpTargetInvert$new(id = "targetinvert", param_vals = list())

- `id` :: `character(1)`  
  Identifier of resulting object, default `"targetinvert"`.

- `param_vals` :: named `list`  
  List of hyperparameter settings, overwriting the hyperparameter
  settings that would otherwise be set during construction. Default
  [`list()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html).

## Input and Output Channels

`PipeOpTargetInvert` has two input channels named `"fun"` and
`"prediction"`. During training, both take `NULL` as input. During
prediction, `"fun"` takes a function and `"prediction"` takes a
[`Prediction`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Prediction.html).

`PipeOpTargetInvert` has one output channel named `"output"` and returns
`NULL` during training and a
[`Prediction`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Prediction.html)
during prediction.

## State

The `$state` is left empty
([`list()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html)).

## Parameters

`PipeOpTargetInvert` has no parameters.

## Internals

Should be used in combination with a subclass of
[`PipeOpTargetTrafo`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTargetTrafo.md).

## Fields

Only fields inherited from
[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOp.md).
