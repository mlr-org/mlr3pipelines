# Add Features According to Expressions

Adds features according to expressions given as formulas that may depend
on values of other features. This can add new features, or can change
existing features.

## Format

[`R6Class`](https://r6.r-lib.org/reference/R6Class.html) object
inheriting from
[`PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple.md)/[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md)/[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOp.md).

## Construction

    PipeOpMutate$new(id = "mutate", param_vals = list())

- `id` :: `character(1)`  
  Identifier of resulting object, default `"mutate"`.

- `param_vals` :: named `list`  
  List of hyperparameter settings, overwriting the hyperparameter
  settings that would otherwise be set during construction. Default
  [`list()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html).

## Input and Output Channels

Input and output channels are inherited from
[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md).

The output is the input
[`Task`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Task.html) with added and/or
mutated features according to the `mutation` parameter.

## State

The `$state` is a named `list` with the `$state` elements inherited from
[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md).

## Parameters

The parameters are the parameters inherited from
[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md),
as well as:

- `mutation` :: named `list` of `formula`  
  Expressions for new features to create (or present features to
  change), in the form of `formula`. Each element of the list is a
  `formula` with the name of the element naming the feature to create or
  change, and the formula expression determining the result. This
  expression may reference other features, as well as variables visible
  at the creation of the `formula` (see examples). Initialized to
  [`list()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html).

- `delete_originals` :: `logical(1)`  
  Whether to delete original features. Even when this is `FALSE`,
  present features may still be overwritten. Initialized to `FALSE`.

## Internals

A `formula` created using the `~` operator always contains a reference
to the `environment` in which the `formula` is created. This makes it
possible to use variables in the `~`-expressions that both reference
either column names or variable names.

Note that the `formula`s in `mutation` are evaluated sequentially. This
allows for using variables that were constructed during evaluation of a
previous formula. However, if existing features are changed, precedence
is given to the original ones before the newly constructed ones.

## Fields

Only fields inherited from
[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOp.md).

## Methods

Only methods inherited from
[`PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple.md)/[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md)/[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOp.md).
