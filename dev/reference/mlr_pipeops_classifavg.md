# Majority Vote Prediction

Perform (weighted) majority vote prediction from classification
[`Prediction`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Prediction.html)s by
connecting `PipeOpClassifAvg` to multiple
[`PipeOpLearner`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/mlr_pipeops_learner.md)
outputs.

Always returns a `"prob"` prediction, regardless of the incoming
[`Learner`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Learner.html)'s
`$predict_type`. The label of the class with the highest predicted
probability is selected as the `"response"` prediction. If the
[`Learner`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Learner.html)'s
`$predict_type` is set to `"prob"`, the prediction obtained is also a
`"prob"` type prediction with the probability predicted to be a weighted
average of incoming predictions.

All incoming
[`Learner`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Learner.html)'s
`$predict_type` must agree.

Weights can be set as a parameter; if none are provided, defaults to
equal weights for each prediction. Defaults to equal weights for each
model.

## Format

[`R6Class`](https://r6.r-lib.org/reference/R6Class.html) inheriting from
[`PipeOpEnsemble`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpEnsemble.md)/[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOp.md).

## Construction

    PipeOpClassifAvg$new(innum = 0, collect_multiplicity = FALSE, id = "classifavg", param_vals = list())

- `innum` :: `numeric(1)`  
  Determines the number of input channels. If `innum` is 0 (default), a
  vararg input channel is created that can take an arbitrary number of
  inputs.

- `collect_multiplicity` :: `logical(1)`  
  If `TRUE`, the input is a
  [`Multiplicity`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/Multiplicity.md)
  collecting channel. This means, a
  [`Multiplicity`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/Multiplicity.md)
  input, instead of multiple normal inputs, is accepted and the members
  are aggregated. This requires `innum` to be 0. Default is `FALSE`.

- `id` :: `character(1)` Identifier of the resulting object, default
  `"classifavg"`.

- `param_vals` :: named `list`  
  List of hyperparameter settings, overwriting the hyperparameter
  settings that would otherwise be set during construction. Default
  [`list()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html).

## Input and Output Channels

Input and output channels are inherited from
[`PipeOpEnsemble`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpEnsemble.md).
Instead of a
[`Prediction`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Prediction.html), a
[`PredictionClassif`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/PredictionClassif.html)
is used as input and output during prediction.

## State

The `$state` is left empty
([`list()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html)).

## Parameters

The parameters are the parameters inherited from the
[`PipeOpEnsemble`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpEnsemble.md).

## Internals

Inherits from
[`PipeOpEnsemble`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpEnsemble.md)
by implementing the `private$weighted_avg_predictions()` method.

## Fields

Only fields inherited from
[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOp.md).

## Methods

Only methods inherited from
[`PipeOpEnsemble`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpEnsemble.md)/[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOp.md).
