# Fix Factor Levels

Fixes factors of type `factor`, `ordered`: Makes sure the factor levels
during prediction are the same as during training; possibly dropping
empty training factor levels before.

Note this may introduce *missing values* during prediction if unseen
factor levels are found.

## Format

[`R6Class`](https://r6.r-lib.org/reference/R6Class.html) object
inheriting from
[`PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple.md)/[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md)/[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOp.md).

## Construction

    PipeOpFixFactors$new(id = "fixfactors", param_vals = list())

- `id` :: `character(1)`  
  Identifier of resulting object, default `"fixfactors"`.

- `param_vals` :: named `list`  
  List of hyperparameter settings, overwriting the hyperparameter
  settings that would otherwise be set during construction. Default
  [`list()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html).

## Input and Output Channels

Input and output channels are inherited from
[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md).

The output is the input
[`Task`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Task.html) with all affected
`factor` and `ordered` feature levels fixed.

## State

The `$state` is a named `list` with the `$state` elements inherited from
[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md),
as well as:

- `levels` :: named `list` of `character`  
  List of factor levels of each affected `factor` or `ordered` feature
  that will be fixed.

## Parameters

The parameters are the parameters inherited from
[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md),
as well as:

- `droplevels` :: `logical(1)`  
  Whether to drop empty factor levels of the training task. Default
  `TRUE`

## Internals

Changes factor levels of columns and attaches them with a new
`data.table` backend and the virtual
[`cbind()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/cbind.html) backend.

## Fields

Only fields inherited from
[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOp.md).

## Methods

Only methods inherited from
[`PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple.md)/[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md)/[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOp.md).
