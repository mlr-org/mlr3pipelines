# Simply Push Input Forward

Simply pushes the input forward. Can be useful during
[`Graph`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/Graph.md)
construction using the `%>>%`-operator to specify which
[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOp.md)
gets connected to which.

## Format

[`R6Class`](https://r6.r-lib.org/reference/R6Class.html) object
inheriting from
[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOp.md).

## Construction

    PipeOpNOP$new(id = "nop", param_vals = list())

- `id` :: `character(1)`  
  Identifier of resulting object, default `"nop"`.

- `param_vals` :: named `list`  
  List of hyperparameter settings, overwriting the hyperparameter
  settings that would otherwise be set during construction. Default
  [`list()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html).

## Input and Output Channels

`PipeOpNOP` has one input channel named `"input"`, taking any input
(`"*"`) both during training and prediction.

`PipeOpNOP` has one output channel named `"output"`, producing the
object given as input (`"*"`) without changes.

## State

The `$state` is left empty
([`list()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html)).

## Parameters

`PipeOpNOP` has no parameters.

## Internals

`PipeOpNOP` is a useful "default" stand-in for a
[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOp.md)/[`Graph`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/Graph.md)
that does nothing.

## Fields

Only fields inherited from
[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOp.md).

## Methods

Only methods inherited from
[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOp.md).
