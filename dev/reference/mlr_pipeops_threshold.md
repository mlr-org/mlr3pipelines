# Change the Threshold of a Classification Prediction

Change the threshold of a `Prediction` during the `predict` step. The
incoming [`Learner`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Learner.html)'s
`$predict_type` needs to be `"prob"`. Internally calls
`PredictionClassif$set_threshold`.

## Format

[`R6Class`](https://r6.r-lib.org/reference/R6Class.html) inheriting from
[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOp.md).

## Construction

    PipeOpThreshold$new(id = "threshold", param_vals = list())

- `id` :: `character(1)` Identifier of the resulting object, default
  `"threshold"`.

- `param_vals` :: named `list`  
  List of hyperparameter settings, overwriting the hyperparameter
  settings that would otherwise be set during construction. Defaults to
  `numeric(0)`.

## Input and Output Channels

During training, the input and output are `NULL`. A
[`PredictionClassif`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/PredictionClassif.html)
is required as input and returned as output during prediction.

## State

The `$state` is left empty
([`list()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html)).

## Parameters

- `thresholds` :: `numeric`  
  A numeric vector of thresholds for the different class levels. May
  have length 1 for binary classification predictions, must otherwise
  have length of the number of target classes; see
  [`PredictionClassif`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/PredictionClassif.html)'s
  `$set_threshold()` method. Initialized to `0.5`, i.e. thresholding for
  binary classification at level `0.5`.

## Fields

Fields inherited from
[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOp.md),
as well as:

- `predict_type` :: `character(1)`  
  Type of prediction to return. Either `"prob"` (default) or
  `"response"`. Setting to `"response"` should rarely be used; it may
  potentially save some memory but has no other benefits.

## Methods

Only methods inherited from
[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOp.md).
