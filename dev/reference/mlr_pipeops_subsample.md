# Subsampling

Subsamples a [`Task`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Task.html) to
use a fraction of the rows.

Sampling happens only during training phase. Subsampling a
[`Task`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Task.html) may be beneficial
for training time at possibly (depending on original
[`Task`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Task.html) size) negligible
cost of predictive performance.

## Format

[`R6Class`](https://r6.r-lib.org/reference/R6Class.html) object
inheriting from
[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md)/[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOp.md).

## Construction

    PipeOpSubsample$new(id = "subsample", param_vals = list())

- `id` :: `character(1)` Identifier of the resulting object, default
  `"subsample"`

- `param_vals` :: named `list`  
  List of hyperparameter settings, overwriting the hyperparameter
  settings that would otherwise be set during construction. Default
  [`list()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html).

## Input and Output Channels

Input and output channels are inherited from
[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md).

The output during training is the input
[`Task`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Task.html) with added or
removed rows according to the sampling. The output during prediction is
the unchanged input.

## State

The `$state` is a named `list` with the `$state` elements inherited from
[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md).

## Parameters

The parameters are the parameters inherited from
[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md);
however, the `affect_columns` parameter is *not* present. Further
parameters are:

- `frac` :: `numeric(1)`  
  Fraction of rows in the
  [`Task`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Task.html) to keep. May
  only be greater than 1 if `replace` is `TRUE`. Initialized to
  `(1 - exp(-1)) == 0.6321`.

- `stratify` :: `logical(1)`  
  Should the subsamples be stratified by target? Initialized to `FALSE`.
  May only be `TRUE` for
  [`TaskClassif`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/TaskClassif.html)
  input and if `use_groups = FALSE`.

- `use_groups` :: `logical(1)`  
  If `TRUE` and if the
  [`Task`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Task.html) has a column
  with role `group`, grouped observations are kept together during
  subsampling. In case of sampling with

- `replace` :: `logical(1)`  
  Sample with replacement? Initialized to `FALSE`.

## Internals

Uses `task$filter()` to remove rows. If `replace` is `TRUE` and
identical rows are added, then the `task$row_roles$use` can *not* be
used to duplicate rows because of \[inaudible\]; instead the
`task$rbind()` function is used, and a new
[`data.table`](https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/reference/data.table.html)
is attached that contains all rows that are being duplicated exactly as
many times as they are being added.

## Fields

Only fields inherited from
[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOp.md).

## Methods

Only methods inherited from
[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md)/[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOp.md).
