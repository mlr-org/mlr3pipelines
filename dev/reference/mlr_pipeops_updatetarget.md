# Transform a Target without an Explicit Inversion

EXPERIMENTAL, API SUBJECT TO CHANGE

Handles target transformation operations that do not need explicit
inversion. In case the new target is required during predict, creates a
vector of `NA`. Works similar to
[`PipeOpTargetTrafo`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTargetTrafo.md)
and
[`PipeOpTargetMutate`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/mlr_pipeops_targetmutate.md),
but forgoes the inversion step. In case target after the `trafo` is a
factor, levels are saved to `$state`.  

During prediction: Sets all target values to `NA` before calling the
`trafo` again. In case target after the `trafo` is a factor, levels
saved in the `state` are set during prediction.

As a special case when `trafo` is `identity` and `new_target_name`
matches an existing column name of the data of the input
[`Task`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Task.html), this column is
set as the new target. Depending on `drop_original_target` the original
target is then either dropped or added to the features.

## Format

Abstract [`R6Class`](https://r6.r-lib.org/reference/R6Class.html)
inheriting from
[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOp.md).

## Construction

    PipeOpUpdateTarget$new(id, param_set = ps(),
      param_vals = list(), packages = character(0))

- `id` :: `character(1)`  
  Identifier of resulting object. See `$id` slot of
  [`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOp.md).

- `param_vals` :: named `list`  
  List of hyperparameter settings, overwriting the hyperparameter
  settings given in `param_set`. The subclass should have its own
  `param_vals` parameter and pass it on to `super$initialize()`. Default
  [`list()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html).

## Parameters

The parameters are the parameters inherited from
[`PipeOpTargetTrafo`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTargetTrafo.md),
as well as:

- `trafo` :: `function`  
  Transformation function for the target. Should only be a function of
  the target, i.e., taking a single argument. Default is `identity`.
  Note, that the data passed on to the target is a `data.table`
  consisting of all target column.

- `new_target_name` :: `character(1)`  
  Optionally give the transformed target a new name. By default the
  original name is used.

- `new_task_type` :: `character(1)`  
  Optionally a new task type can be set. Legal types are listed in
  `mlr_reflections$task_types$type`. \#' `drop_original_target` ::
  `logical(1)`  
  Whether to drop the original target column. Default: `TRUE`.

## State

The `$state` is a list of class levels for each target after trafo.
[`list()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html) if none of the targets have
levels.

## Fields

Only fields inherited from
[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOp.md).
