# Class Weights for Sample Weighting

Adds a class weight column to the
[`Task`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Task.html) that different
[`Learner`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Learner.html)s may be
able to use for sample weighting. Sample weights are added to each
sample according to the target class.

Only binary [classification
tasks](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/TaskClassif.html) are
supported.

Caution: when constructed naively without parameter, the weights are all
set to 1. The `minor_weight` parameter must be adjusted for this
[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOp.md) to
be useful.

Note this only sets the `"weights_learner"` column. It therefore
influences the behaviour of subsequent
[`Learner`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Learner.html)s, but does
not influence resampling or evaluation metric weights.

## Format

[`R6Class`](https://r6.r-lib.org/reference/R6Class.html) object
inheriting from
[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md)/[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOp.md).

## Construction

    PipeOpClassWeights$new(id = "classweights", param_vals = list())

- `id` :: `character(1)` Identifier of the resulting object, default
  `"classweights"`

- `param_vals` :: named `list`  
  List of hyperparameter settings, overwriting the hyperparameter
  settings that would otherwise be set during construction. Default
  [`list()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html).

## Input and Output Channels

Input and output channels are inherited from
[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md).
Instead of a [`Task`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Task.html), a
[`TaskClassif`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/TaskClassif.html) is
used as input and output during training and prediction.

The output during training is the input
[`Task`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Task.html) with added
weights column according to target class. The output during prediction
is the unchanged input.

## State

The `$state` is a named `list` with the `$state` elements inherited from
[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md).

## Parameters

The parameters are the parameters inherited from
[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md);
however, the `affect_columns` parameter is *not* present. Further
parameters are:

- `minor_weight` :: `numeric(1)`  
  Weight given to samples of the minor class. Major class samples have
  weight 1. Initialized to 1.

## Internals

Introduces, or overwrites, the "weights" column in the
[`Task`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Task.html). However, the
[`Learner`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Learner.html) method
needs to respect weights for this to have an effect.

The newly introduced column is named `.WEIGHTS`; there will be a naming
conflict if this column already exists and is *not* a weight column
itself.

## Fields

Only fields inherited from
[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOp.md).

## Methods

Only methods inherited from
[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOpTaskPreproc.md)/[`PipeOp`](https://mlr3pipelines.mlr-org.com/dev/reference/PipeOp.md).
