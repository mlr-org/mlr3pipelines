#' @title Preprocess Date Features
#'
#' @usage NULL
#' @name mlr_pipeops_datefeatures
#' @format [`R6Class`][R6::R6Class] object inheriting from [`PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple`]/[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`]/[`PipeOp`].
#'
#' @description
#' Based on `POSIXct` columns of the data, a set of date related features is computed and added to
#' the feature set of the output task. If no `POSIXct` column is found, the original task is
#' returned unaltered. This functionality is based on the `add_datepart()` and
#' `add_cyclic_datepart()` functions from the `fastai` library. If operation on only particular
#' `POSIXct` columns is requested, use the `affect_columns` parameter inherited from
#' [`PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple`].
#'
#' If `cyclic = TRUE`, cyclic features are computed for the features `"month"`, `"week_of_year"`,
#' `"day_of_year"`, `"day_of_month"`, `"day_of_week"`, `"hour"`, `"minute"` and `"second"`. This
#' means that for each feature `x`, two additional features are computed, namely the sine and cosine
#' transformation of `2 * pi * x / max_x` (here `max_x` is the largest possible value the feature
#' could take on `+ 1`, assuming the lowest possible value is given by 0, e.g., for hours from 0 to
#' 23, this is 24). This is useful to respect the cyclical nature of features such as seconds, i.e.,
#' second 21 and second 22 are one second apart, but so are second 60 and second 1 of the next
#' minute.
#'
#' @section Construction:
#' ```
#' PipeOpDateFeatures$new(id = "datefeatures", param_vals = list())
#' ```
#'
#' * `id` :: `character(1)`\cr
#'   Identifier of resulting object, default `"datefeatures"`.
#' * `param_vals` :: named `list`\cr
#'   List of hyperparameter settings, overwriting the hyperparameter settings that would otherwise
#'   be set during construction. Default `list()`.
#'
#' @section Input and Output Channels:
#' Input and output channels are inherited from [`PipeOpTaskPreproc`].
#'
#' The output is the input [`Task`][mlr3::Task] with date-related features computed and added to the
#' feature set of the output task and the `POSIXct` columns of the data removed from the
#' feature set (depending on the value of `keep_date_var`).
#'
#' @section State:
#' The `$state` is a named `list` with the `$state` elements inherited from
#' [`PipeOpTaskPreproc`].
#'
#' @section Parameters:
#' The parameters are the parameters inherited from [`PipeOpTaskPreproc`], as well as:
#' * `keep_date_var` :: `logical(1)`\cr
#'   Should the `POSIXct` columns be kept as features? Default FALSE.
#' * `cyclic` :: `logical(1)`\cr
#'   Should cyclic features be computed? See Internals. Default FALSE.
#' * `year` :: `logical(1)`\cr
#'   Should the year be extracted as a feature? Default TRUE.
#' * `month` :: `logical(1)`\cr
#'   Should the month be extracted as a feature? Default TRUE.
#' * `week_of_year` :: `logical(1)`\cr
#'   Should the week of the year be extracted as a feature? Default TRUE.
#' * `day_of_year` :: `logical(1)`\cr
#'   Should the day of the year be extracted as a feature? Default TRUE.
#' * `day_of_month` :: `logical(1)`\cr
#'   Should the day of the month be extracted as a feature? Default TRUE.
#' * `day_of_week` :: `logical(1)`\cr
#'   Should the day of the week be extracted as a feature? Default TRUE.
#' * `hour` :: `logical(1)`\cr
#'   Should the hour be extracted as a feature? Default TRUE.
#' * `minute` :: `logical(1)`\cr
#'   Should the minute be extracted as a feature? Default TRUE.
#' * `second` :: `logical(1)`\cr
#'   Should the second be extracted as a feature? Default TRUE.
#' * `is_day` :: `logical(1)`\cr
#'   Should a feature be extracted indicating whether it is day time (06:00am - 08:00pm)?
#'   Default TRUE.
#'
#' @section Internals:
#' The cyclic feature transformation always assumes that values range from 0, so some values
#' (e.g. day of the month) are shifted before sine/cosine transform.

#' Only fields inherited from [`PipeOp`].

#' Only methods inherited from [`PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple`]/[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`]/[`PipeOp`].
