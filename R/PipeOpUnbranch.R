#' @name mlr_pipeops_unbranch
#' @format [`R6Class`] object inheriting from [`PipeOp`].
#'
#' @description
#' Used to bring together different paths created by [`PipeOpBranch`].
#'
#' @section Construction:
#' ```
#' PipeOpUnbranch$new(options, id = "unbranch", param_vals = list())
#' ```
#' * `options` :: `numeric(1)` | `character`\cr
#'   If `options` is 0, a vararg input channel is created that can take
#'   any number of inputs.
#'   If `options` is a nonzero integer number, it determines the number of
#'   input channels / options that are created, named `input1`...`input<n>`. The
#'   If `options` is a `character`, it determines the names of channels directly.
#'   The difference between these three is purely cosmetic if the user chooses
#'   to produce channel names matching with the corresponding [`PipeOpBranch`].
#'   However, it is not necessary to have matching names and the *vararg* option
#'   is always viable.
#' * `id` :: `character(1)`\cr
#'   Identifier of resulting object, default `"unbranch"`.
#' * `param_vals` :: named `list`\cr
#'   List of hyperparameter settings, overwriting the hyperparameter settings that would otherwise be set during construction. Default `list()`.
#'
#' @section Input and Output:
#' [`PipeOpUnbranch`] has multiple input channels depending on the `options` construction argument, named `"input1"`, `"input2"`, ...
#' if `options` is a nonzero integer and named after each `options` value if `options` is a `character`; if `options` is 0, there is only one
#' *vararg* input channel named `"..."`.
#' All input channels take any argument (`"*"`) both during training and prediction.
#'
#' [`PipeOpUnbranch`] has one output channel named `"output"`, producing the only [`NO_OP`] object received as input (`"*"`),
#' both during training and prediction.
#'
#' @section State:
#' The `$state` is left empty (`list()`).
#'
#' @section Parameters:
#' [`PipeOpUnbranch`] has no parameters.
#'
#' @section Internals:
#' See [`PipeOpBranch`] Internals on how alternative path branching works.
#'
#' @section Fields:
#' Only fields inherited from [`PipeOp`].
#'
#' @section Methods:
#' Only methods inherited from [`PipeOp`].
