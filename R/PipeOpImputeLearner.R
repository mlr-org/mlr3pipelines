#' @usage NULL
#' @name mlr_pipeops_imputelearner
#' @format [`R6Class`] object inheriting from [`PipeOpImpute`]/[`PipeOp`].
#'
#' @description
#' Impute features by fitting a [`Learner`][mlr3::Learner] for each feature.
#' Uses the features indicated by the `context_columns` parameter as features to train the imputation [`Learner`][mlr3::Learner].
#' Note this parameter is part of the [`PipeOpImpute`] base class and explained there.
#'
#' Additionally, only features supported by the learner can be imputed; i.e. learners of type
#' `regr` can only impute features of type `integer` and `numeric`, while `classif` can impute
#' features of type `factor`, `ordered` and `logical`.
#'
#'
#' @section Construction:
#' ```
#' PipeOpImputeLearner$new(learner, id = NULL, param_vals = list())
#' ```
#'
#' * `id` :: `character(1)`\cr
#'   Identifier of resulting object, default `"impute."`, followed by the `id` of the `Learner`.
#' * `learner` :: [`Learner`][mlr3::Learner] | `character(1)`
#'   [`Learner`][mlr3::Learner] to wrap, or a string identifying a [`Learner`][mlr3::Learner] in the [`mlr3::mlr_learners`] [`Dictionary`][mlr3misc::Dictionary].
#'   The [`Learner`][mlr3::Learner] needs to be able to handle missing values, i.e. have the `missings` property.
#' * `param_vals` :: named `list`\cr
#'   List of hyperparameter settings, overwriting the hyperparameter settings that would otherwise be set during construction. Default `list()`.
#'
#' @section Input and Output Channels:
#' Input and output channels are inherited from [`PipeOpImpute`].
#'
#' The output is the input [`Task`][mlr3::Task] with missing values from all affected features imputed by the trained model.
#'
#' @section State:
#' The `$state` is a named `list` with the `$state` elements inherited from [`PipeOpImpute`].
#'
#' The `$state$models` is a named `list` of `models` created by the [`Learner`][mlr3::Learner]'s `$.train()` function
#' for each column. If a column consists of missing values only during training, the `model` is `0` or the levels of the
#' feature; these are used for sampling during prediction.
#'
#' @section Parameters:
#' The parameters are the parameters inherited from [`PipeOpImpute`], in addition to the parameters of the [`Learner`][mlr3::Learner]
#' used for imputation.
#'
#' @section Internals:
#' Uses the `$train` and `$predict` functions of the provided learner. Features that are entirely `NA` are imputed as `0`
#' or randomly sampled from available (`factor` / `logical`) levels.
#'
#' The [`Learner`][mlr3::Learner] does *not* necessarily need to handle missing values in cases
#' where `context_columns` is chosen well (or there is only one column with missing values present).
#'
#' @section Fields:
#' Fields inherited from [`PipeOpTaskPreproc`]/[`PipeOp`], as well as:
#' * `learner` :: [`Learner`][mlr3::Learner]\cr
#'   [`Learner`][mlr3::Learner] that is being wrapped. Read-only.
#' * `learner_models` :: `list` of [`Learner`][mlr3::Learner] | `NULL`\cr
#'   [`Learner`][mlr3::Learner] that is being wrapped. This list is named by features for which a `Learner` was fitted, and
#'   contains the same `Learner`, but with different respective models for each feature. If this `PipeOp` is not trained,
#'   this is an empty `list`. For features that were entirely `NA` during training, the `list` contains `NULL` elements.
#'
#' @section Methods:
#' Only methods inherited from [`PipeOpImpute`]/[`PipeOp`].
