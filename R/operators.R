########## Basic operator %>>% for 1-to-1, 1-to-n, n-to-1 ##########


# FIXME: getter for length of channels
# FIXME: lhs and rhs must be the number of pipeops,  and for each pair the number of channels must be equal

# we nneed to DOCUMENT semantics of the >> op, wrt to what happens with multiple rhs / lhs channels

# we need to simply document a few cases where >> works. it does not need to in totally arbitrary cases, but robustly in the cases it
# asserts
