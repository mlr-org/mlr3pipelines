#' @title Impute Features by their Mode

#' @name mlr_pipeops_imputemode
#' @format [`R6Class`][R6::R6Class] object inheriting from [`PipeOpImpute`]/[`PipeOp`].
#'
#' @description
#' Impute features by their mode. Supports factors as well as logical and numerical features.
#' If multiple modes are present then imputed values are sampled randomly from them.
#'
#' @section Construction:
#' ```
#' PipeOpImputeMode$new(id = "imputemode", param_vals = list())
#' ```
#'
#' * `id` :: `character(1)`\cr
#'   Identifier of resulting object, default `"imputemode"`.
#' * `param_vals` :: named `list`\cr
#'   List of hyperparameter settings, overwriting the hyperparameter settings that would otherwise be set during construction. Default `list()`.
#'
#' @section Input and Output Channels:
#' Input and output channels are inherited from [`PipeOpImpute`].
#'
#' The output is the input [`Task`][mlr3::Task] with all affected features missing values imputed by (column-wise) mode.
#'
#' @section State:
#' The `$state` is a named `list` with the `$state` elements inherited from [`PipeOpImpute`].
#'
#' The `$state$model` is a named `list` of a vector of length one of the type of the feature, indicating the mode of the respective feature.
#'
#' @section Parameters:
#' The parameters are the parameters inherited from [`PipeOpImpute`].
#'
#' @section Internals:
#' Features that are entirely `NA` are imputed as
#' the following: For `factor` or `ordered`, random levels are sampled uniformly at random.
#' For logicals, `TRUE` or `FALSE` are sampled uniformly at random.
#' Numerics and integers are imputed as `0`.
#'
#' Note that every random imputation is drawn independently, so different values may be imputed
#' if multiple values are missing.
#'
#' @section Fields:
#' Only fields inherited from [`PipeOp`].
#'
#' @section Methods:
#' Only methods inherited from [`PipeOpImpute`]/[`PipeOp`].
