#' @description
#' A [`Multiplicity`] class S3 object.
#'
#' The function of multiplicities is to indicate that [`PipeOp`]s should be executed
#' multiple times with multiple values.
#'
#' A [`Multiplicity`] is a container, like a
#' `list()`, that contains multiple values. If the message that is passed along the
#' edge of a [`Graph`] is a [`Multiplicity`]-object, then the [`PipeOp`] that receives
#' this object will *usually* be called once for each contained value. The result of
#' each of these calls is then, again, packed in a [`Multiplicity`] and sent along the
#' outgoing edge(s) of that [`PipeOp`]. This means that a [`Multiplicity`] can cause
#' multiple [`PipeOp`]s in a row to be run multiple times, where the run for each element
#' of the [`Multiplicity`] is independent from the others.
#'
#' Most [`PipeOp`]s only return a [`Multiplicity`] if their input was a [`Multiplicity`]
#' (and after having run their code multiple times, once for each entry). However,
#' there are a few special [`PipeOp`]s that are "aware" of [`Multiplicity`] objects. These
#' may either *create* a [`Multiplicity`] even though not having a [`Multiplicity`] input
#' (e.g. [`PipeOpReplicate`] or [`PipeOpOVRSplit`]) -- causing the subsequent [`PipeOp`]s
#' to be run multiple times -- or *collect* a [`Multiplicity`], being called only once
#' even though their input is a [`Multiplicity`] (e.g. [`PipeOpOVRUnite`] or [`PipeOpFeatureUnion`]
#' if constructed with the `collect_multiplicity` argument set to `TRUE`). The combination
#' of these mechanisms makes it possible for parts of a [`Graph`] to be called variably
#' many times if "sandwiched" between [`Multiplicity`] creating and collecting [`PipeOp`]s.
#'
#' Whether a [`PipeOp`] creates or collects a [`Multiplicity`] is indicated by the `$input`
#' or `$output` slot (which indicate names and types of in/out channels). If the `train` and
#' `predict` types of an input or output are surrounded by square brackets ("`[`", "`]`"), then
#' this channel handles a [`Multiplicity`] explicitly. Depending on the function of the [`PipeOp`],
#' it will usually collect (input channel) or create (output channel) a [`Multiplicity`].
#' [`PipeOp`]s without this indicator are [`Multiplicity`] agnostic and blindly execute their
#' function multiple times when given a [`Multiplicity`].
#'
#' If a [`PipeOp`] is trained on a [`Multiplicity`], the `$state` slot is set to a [`Multiplicity`]
#' as well; this [`Multiplicity`] contains the "original" `$state` resulting from each individual
#' call of the [`PipeOP`] with the input [`Multiplicity`]'s content. If a [`PipeOp`] was trained
#' with a [`Multiplicity`], then the `predict()` argument must be a [`Multiplicity`] with the same
#' number of elements.
