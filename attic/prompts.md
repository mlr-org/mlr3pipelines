Please do a code-review of this branch. Check out the diff with `master` to see which files were touched here. Look at other things that may (or may not!) be relevant here, e.g. LearnerAvg.R, PipeOpEnsemble.R, PipeOpLearner.R. Thoroughly consider what things could be improved, and also think if the things may look like they should be improved at first but it would actually not be a good idea on second thought. Also do a thorough review of the tests: Are they sufficient, do they cover all the important cases? ultrathink
