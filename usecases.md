## Use Cases

### Usecase: Linear Pipeline

#### Usecase a): Linear Pipeline

Scenario:
We obtain a task (iris) and a learner(rpart) from mlr3.
Before we train the learner, we want to transform the data using PCA.

We concatenate a `PipeOpPCA` and a `PipeOpLearner` using the `%>>%` (then) operator.
This internally does the following:
  - Wrap the [PO's] into **GraphNodes**.
  - Chains them together and returns a **Graph**.

```r
task = mlr_tasks$get("iris")
lrn_rp = mlr_learners$get("classif.rpart")
g = PipeOpScale() %>>% PipeOpPCA() %>>% PipeOpLearner(lrn_rp)
g$train(task)
g$predict(task)
```

#### Usecase b): Resample Linear Pipeline

Scenario:
We want to resample the Graph on different folds of the data.

We create a `GraphLearner` from the Graph and use **mlr3's** resampling.

```r
lrn_g = GraphLearner$new(graph = g)
lrn$parvals = list(pca.center = TRUE, rpart.cp = 0.1)
resampling = mlr_resamplings$get("holdout")
rr = resample([[Task]], lrn_g, resampling)
```

Access results:
```r
rr[1, "models"]$learner.model[["rpart"]]$learner.model
rr[1, "models"]$learner.model[["pca"]]$params
```


#### Usecase c): Tune Linear Pipeline

Scenario:
We want to tune the Graph.

We use the `GraphLearner` and use **mlr3's** tuning.

```r
measures = mlr_measures$mget("mmce")
param_set = paradox::ParamSet$new(
  params = list(
   ParamLgl$new("pca.center"),
   ParamDbl$new("rpart.cp", lower = 0.001, upper = 0.1)
)
ff = FitnessFunction$new([[Task]], lrn_g, resampling, measures, param_set)
terminator = TerminatorEvaluations$new(10)
rs = TunerRandomSearch$new(ff, terminator)
tr = rs$tune()$tune_result()
```

### Usecase: Feature union

```r
op1 = PipeOpScale$new()
op2a = PipeOpPCA$new()
op2b = PipeOpNULL$new()
op3 = PipeOpFeatureUnion$new()
op4 = PipeOpLearner$new(learner = "classif.rpart")

op1 %>>% gunion(op2a, op2b) %>>% op3 %>>% op4
```



### Usecase: Bagging (Downsampling, Modelling and Modelaveraging)

Scenario:
We want to do bagging (Train several models on subsamples of the data and
average predictions).

We use the `PipeOpDownSample` operator in conjunction with a `PipeOpLearner` to train a model. `greplicate()` let's us do the same operation multiple times.
Afterwards we average all predictions using `PipeOpModelAverage`

```r
op1 = PipeOpDownSample$new(rate = 0.6)
op2 = PipeOpLearner$new("classif.rpart")
op3 = PipeOpModelAverage$new()

greplicate(op1 %>>% op2, 30) %>>% op3
```


#FIXME:
  Info: If our predictions are numeric, we simply average.
      If our predictions are binary, we majority vote (?)
      If our predictions are probabilities, we average (?)
      If our predictions are multiclass, we (?).
      Are there any other situations ?

### Usecase: Stacking

Scenario:
We want to do stacking (Train several models on the data and combine predictions).

#### Usecase a): Stacking with simple Averaging

We use various `PipeOpLearner`'s' to train models. `gunion()` let's us put the learner's parallel to each other.
Afterwards we average all predictions using `PipeOpModelAverage`.

```r
op1 = PipeOpLearner$new("regr.rpart")
op2 = PipeOpLearner$new("regr.svm")
gunion(op1, op2) %>>% PipeOpModelAverage$new()
```

#### Usecase b): Stacking with SuperLearner

Instead of using `PipeOpModelAverage`, we combine predictions to a `PipeOpLearner`.
Instead of a `PipeOpLearner` we use a `PipeOpLearnerCV`, in order to avoid overfitting.

```r
# Superlearner: We instead use PipeOpLearnerCV
op1 = PipeOpLearnerCV("regr.rpart")
op2 = PipeOpLearnerCV("regr.svm")
gunion(op1, op2) %>>% PipeOpFeatureUnion() %>>% PipeOpLearner("regr.lm")
```


#### Usecase c): Stacking with SuperLearner and original data.

By adding a `PipeOpNull`, we add the original features to the SuperLearner.

```r
gunion(op1, op2, PipeOpNull) %>>% PipeOpFeatureUnion() %>>% PipeOpLearner("regr.lm")
```

#### Usecase d): Multilevel Stacking

We can do the same on multiple levels by just adding the same `PipeOpLearnerCV()` again after the feature union.

```r
g = gunion(op1, op2, PipeOpNull) %>>% PipeOpFeatureUnion() %>>%
	gunion(op1, op2) %>>% PipeOpFeatureUnion() %>>%
	PipeOpLearner("regr.lm")
```


### Usecase: Multiclass with Binary

Scenario:
We have a multiclass target, and want to predict each class in a binarized manner.
This occurs, for example if our model can only do binary classification.

We use `PipeOpMultiClass2Binary` in order to split our [[Task]] up into multiple binary [[Task]]s.
Afterwards, we replicate our learner $k$ (where $k$ = number of classes - 1) times.
In order to aggregate the predictions for different classes, we use the `PipeOpModelAverage`.

```r
op1 = PipeOpMultiClass2Binary(codebook)
op2 = PipeOpLearner("classif.svm")

op1 %>>% greplicate(op2, k) %>>% PipeOpModelAverage$new()
# or:
op1 %>=>% greplicate(op2, k) %>>% PipeOpModelAverage$new()
```


### Usecase: Multiplexing of different Ops

Scenario:
We want our pipeline to branch out, either in one direction or the other.
This is usefull, for example when tuning over multiple learners.

####  Usecase: Multiplexing different learners

We use the `PipeOpBranch` in order to have our data flow only to one of the following operators.
Afterwards we collect the two streams using `PipeOpUnbranch`.
We can now treat the pipeline like a linear pipeline.


```r
op1 = PipeOpLearner$new("regr.rpart")
op2 = PipeOpLearner$new("regr.svm")
g = PipeOpBranch$new(selected = 1) %>>% gunion(op1, op2) %>>% PipeOpUnbranch(aggrFun = NULL)
```


####  Usecase: Multiplexing preprocessing steps

```r
op1 = PipeOpLearnerPCA$new()
op2 = PipeOpNULL$new()
op3 = PipeOpLearner$new("classif.rpart")

g = PipeOpBranch$new(selected = 1) %>>% gunion(op1, op2) %>>% PipeOpUnbranch(aggrFun = NULL) %>>% op3
```

**FIXME:** Does every PipeOp have a default method when NULL is passed?


### Usecase: Chunk data into k parts, train on each, then model average

Scenario:
We want our pipeline to branch out, either in one direction or the other.
This is usefull, for example when tuning over multiple learners.


We use the `PipeOpChunk` operator to partition the [[Task]] into $k$ smaller [[Task]]s.
Afterwards we train $k$ learners on each sub[[Task]].
Afterwards the predictions are averaged in order to get a single prediction.

```r
PipeOpChunk(k) %>>% greplicate(PipeOpLearner("classif.rpart"), 10) %>>% PipeOpModelAvg()
```


### Usecase: Thresholding

Scenario:
We want to obtain an optimal threshold in order to decide whether something is of class x or y.

We use `PipeOpLearnerCV` to obtain cross-validated predictions. Afterwards we use `PipeOpThreshold()` to compute an
optimal threshold.

```r
op1 = PipeOpLearnerCV$new(""classif.rpart")
op2 = PipeOpThreshold$new(method, measure, ...)
g = op1 %>>% op2
```

## Unknown territory, Here Be Dragons
------------------------------------


### Usecase: ThresholdingTrafo y (logarithm of y)

Scenario:
We want to transform our target variable, for example using a log-transform.

We use the `PipeOpTrafoY` in order to log-transform the data.
We use another `PipeOpTrafoY` after the learner in order to re-transform our data onto the original scale.

```r
top = PipeOpTrafoY(train = log, predict = identity)
retop = PipeOpTrafoY(train = identity, predict = exp)

g = top %>>% PipeOpLearner("classif.svm") %>>% retop
```

What happens:
```
  - g$train([[Task]]) [[trafoY(log)) >>  train("classif.svm", [[Task]]) %>>% identity]]
  - g$predict([[Task]]) [[identity >> predict(model, [[Task]]) >> trafoPreds(exp)]]
```

FIXME:
  - Using the same operator twice would violate the acyclic property.
  - We can not tune over **par.vals** of TrafoY, as we have a hard time storing them.
  - User needs to ensure that trafos are correct

### Usecase: MultiOutput / Multiple Targets (1 [[Task]], 3 Outputs, NoCV)


####  Usecase a): MultiOutput Parallel

Scenario:
We have three possible output variables we want to predict in parallel.

We set different targets before training each learner using `PipeOpSetTarget`.
Afterwards the different predictions are collected with `PipeOpModelAverage`.

```r
g = gunion(
  PipeOpSetTarget("out1") %>>% PipeOpLearner("rpart", id = "r1"),
  PipeOpSetTarget("out2") %>>% PipeOpLearner("rpart", id = "r2"),
  PipeOpsetTarget("final_out") %>>% PipeOpLearner("rpart", id = "r3")
  ) %>>% PipeOpModelAverage()
```

####  Usecase b): MultiOutput Chained

Scenario:
We have three possible output variables available during training, but they will not be availalbe during test time.
We want to leverage info from out1 and out2 to improve prediction on final_out*

We obtain cross-validated predictions using `PipeOpLearnerCV` sequentially for each target and use them to train the sequential models.

```r
pnop = PipeOpNull()

g = PipeOpSetTarget("out1") %>>%
  gunion(PipeOpLearnerCV("rpart", id = "r1"), pnop) %>>%
  PipeOpFeatureUnion() %>>%
  PipeOpSetTarget("out2", id = "r2") %>>%
  gunion(PipeOpLearnerCV("rpart"), pnop) %>>%
  PipeOpLearnerCV() %>>%
  PipeOpsetTarget("final_out") %>>%
  PipeOpLearner("rpart", id = "r3")
```

####  Usecase c): Hurdle Models

Scenario:
We have a zero-inflated numeric target variable (e.g. amount unpaid bills).
We want to leverage the info that most are $0$ in our model.

We obtain cross-validated predictions for whether the target variable is 0.
We the use the prediction for this intermediate target for the final prediction.


```r
pnop = PipeOpNull()
# data is our dt with a numeric "target"
data$target_is_null = data$target > 0
g = PipeOpSetTarget("target_is_null") %>>%
  gunion(PipeOpLearnerCV("rpart", id = "r1"), pnop) %>>%
  PipeOpFeatureUnion() %>>%
  PipeOpSetTarget("target") %>>%
  PipeOpLearner("rpart", id = "r3")
```
