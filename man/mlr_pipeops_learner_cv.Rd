\title{Wrap a Learner into a PipeOp with Cross-validated Predictions as Features}
\format{
\code{\link[R6:R6Class]{R6Class}} object inheriting from \code{\link{PipeOpTaskPreproc}}/\code{\link{PipeOp}}.
}
\description{
Wraps an \code{\link[mlr3:Learner]{mlr3::Learner}} into a \code{\link{PipeOp}}.

Returns cross-validated predictions during training as a \code{\link[mlr3:Task]{Task}} and stores a model of the
\code{\link[mlr3:Learner]{Learner}} trained on the whole data in \verb{$state}. This is used to create a similar
\code{\link[mlr3:Task]{Task}} during prediction.
Optionally, the fitted models obtained during the resampling phase can be reused for prediction by averaging
their predictions, avoiding the need for an additional fit on the complete training data.

The \code{\link[mlr3:Task]{Task}} gets features depending on the capsuled \code{\link[mlr3:Learner]{Learner}}'s
\verb{$predict_type}. If the \code{\link[mlr3:Learner]{Learner}}'s \verb{$predict.type} is \code{"response"}, a feature \verb{<ID>.response} is created,
for \verb{$predict.type} \code{"prob"} the \verb{<ID>.prob.<CLASS>} features are created, and for \verb{$predict.type} \code{"se"} the new columns
are \verb{<ID>.response} and \verb{<ID>.se}. \verb{<ID>} denotes the \verb{$id} of the \code{PipeOpLearnerCV} object.

Inherits the \verb{$param_set} (and therefore \verb{$param_set$values}) from the \code{\link[mlr3:Learner]{Learner}} it is constructed from.

\code{PipeOpLearnerCV} can be used to create "stacking" or "super learning" \code{\link{Graph}}s that use the output of one \code{\link[mlr3:Learner]{Learner}}
as feature for another \code{\link[mlr3:Learner]{Learner}}. Because the \code{PipeOpLearnerCV} erases the original input features, it is often
useful to use \code{\link{PipeOpFeatureUnion}} to bind the prediction \code{\link[mlr3:Task]{Task}} to the original input \code{\link[mlr3:Task]{Task}}.

\section{Construction}{


\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{PipeOpLearnerCV$new(learner, id = NULL, param_vals = list())
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}
\itemize{
\item \code{learner} :: \code{\link[mlr3:Learner]{Learner}} \cr
\code{\link[mlr3:Learner]{Learner}} to use for cross validation / prediction, or a string identifying a
\code{\link[mlr3:Learner]{Learner}} in the \code{\link[mlr3:mlr_learners]{mlr3::mlr_learners}} \code{\link[mlr3misc:Dictionary]{Dictionary}}.
This argument is always cloned; to access the \code{\link[mlr3:Learner]{Learner}} inside \code{PipeOpLearnerCV} by-reference, use \verb{$learner}.\cr
\item \code{id} :: \code{character(1)}
Identifier of the resulting object, internally defaulting to the \code{id} of the \code{\link[mlr3:Learner]{Learner}} being wrapped.
\item \code{param_vals} :: named \code{list}\cr
List of hyperparameter settings, overwriting the hyperparameter settings that would otherwise be set during construction. Default \code{list()}.
}
}

\section{Input and Output Channels}{

\code{PipeOpLearnerCV} has one input channel named \code{"input"}, taking a \code{\link[mlr3:Task]{Task}} specific to the \code{\link[mlr3:Learner]{Learner}}
type given to \code{learner} during construction; both during training and prediction.

\code{PipeOpLearnerCV} has one output channel named \code{"output"}, producing a \code{\link[mlr3:Task]{Task}} specific to the \code{\link[mlr3:Learner]{Learner}}
type given to \code{learner} during construction; both during training and prediction.

The output is a task with the same target as the input task, with features replaced by predictions made by the \code{\link[mlr3:Learner]{Learner}}.
During training, this prediction is the out-of-sample prediction made by \code{\link[mlr3:resample]{resample}}, during prediction, this is the
ordinary prediction made on the data by a \code{\link[mlr3:Learner]{Learner}} trained on the training phase data.
}

\section{State}{

The \verb{$state} is set to the \verb{$state} slot of the \code{\link[mlr3:Learner]{Learner}} object, together with the \verb{$state} elements inherited from the
\code{\link{PipeOpTaskPreproc}}. It is a named \code{list} with the inherited members, as well as:
\itemize{
\item \code{model} :: \code{any}\cr
Model created by the \code{\link[mlr3:Learner]{Learner}}'s \verb{$.train()} function.
\item \code{train_log} :: \code{\link[data.table:data.table]{data.table}} with columns \code{class} (\code{character}), \code{msg} (\code{character})\cr
Errors logged during training.
\item \code{train_time} :: \code{numeric(1)}\cr
Training time, in seconds.
\item \code{predict_log} :: \code{NULL} | \code{\link[data.table:data.table]{data.table}} with columns \code{class} (\code{character}), \code{msg} (\code{character})\cr
Errors logged during prediction.
\item \code{predict_time} :: \code{NULL} | \code{numeric(1)}
Prediction time, in seconds.
\item \code{predict_method} :: \code{character(1)}\cr
\code{"full"} when prediction uses a learner fitted on all training data, \code{"cv_ensemble"} when predictions are averaged over
models trained on resampling folds.
\item \code{cv_model_states} :: \code{NULL} | \code{list}\cr
Present for \code{predict_method = "cv_ensemble"}. Contains the states of the learners trained on each resampling fold.
}

This state is given the class \code{"pipeop_learner_cv_state"}.
}

\section{Parameters}{

The parameters are the parameters inherited from the \code{\link{PipeOpTaskPreproc}}, as well as the parameters of the \code{\link[mlr3:Learner]{Learner}} wrapped by this object.
Besides that, parameters introduced are:
\itemize{
\item \code{resampling.method} :: \code{character(1)}\cr
Which resampling method do we want to use. Currently only supports \code{"cv"} and \code{"insample"}. \code{"insample"} generates
predictions with the model trained on all training data.
\item \code{resampling.folds} :: \code{numeric(1)}\cr
Number of cross validation folds. Initialized to 3. Only used for \code{resampling.method = "cv"}.
\item \code{keep_response} :: \code{logical(1)}\cr
Only effective during \code{"prob"} prediction: Whether to keep response values, if available. Initialized to \code{FALSE}.
\item \code{resampling.predict_method} :: \code{character(1)}\cr
Controls how predictions are produced after training. \code{"full"} (default) fits the wrapped learner on the entire training data.
\code{"cv_ensemble"} reuses the models fitted during resampling and averages their predictions. This option currently supports
classification and regression learners together with \code{resampling.method = "cv"}.
\item \code{resampling.prob_aggr} :: \code{character(1)}\cr
Probability aggregation used when \code{"cv_ensemble"} predictions are produced for classification learners that can emit class probabilities.
Shares the semantics with \code{\link{PipeOpClassifAvg}}: \code{"mean"} (linear opinion pool, default) and \code{"log"} (log opinion pool / product of experts).
Only present for learners that support \code{"prob"} predictions.
\item \code{resampling.prob_aggr_eps} :: \code{numeric(1)}\cr
Stabilization constant applied when \code{resampling.prob_aggr = "log"} to clamp probabilities before taking logarithms.
Defaults to \code{1e-12}. Only present for learners that support \code{"prob"} predictions.
\item \code{resampling.se_aggr} :: \code{character(1)}\cr
Standard error aggregation used when \code{"cv_ensemble"} predictions are produced for regression learners with \code{predict_type}
containing \code{"se"}. Shares the definitions with \code{\link{PipeOpRegrAvg}}, i.e. \code{"predictive"}, \code{"mean"}, \code{"within"}, \code{"between"}, \code{"none"}.
Initialized to \code{"predictive"} (within-fold variance plus between-fold disagreement) when constructed with a \code{\link[mlr3:Learner]{Learner}} that has \code{predict_type = "se"};
otherwise to \code{"none"}.\cr
Only present for learners that support \code{"se"} predictions.
\item \code{resampling.se_aggr_rho} :: \code{numeric(1)}\cr
Equicorrelation parameter for \code{resampling.se_aggr = "mean"}, interpreted as in \code{\link{PipeOpRegrAvg}}. Ignored otherwise.
Defaults to \code{0} when \code{resampling.se_aggr = "mean"}.\cr
Only present for learners that support \code{"se"} predictions.
}

\section{Internals}{

The \verb{$state} is currently not updated by prediction, so the \verb{$state$predict_log} and \verb{$state$predict_time} will always be \code{NULL}.

\itemize{
\item \code{learner} :: \code{\link[mlr3:Learner]{Learner}}\cr

\item \code{learner_model} :: \code{\link[mlr3:Learner]{Learner}}\cr
