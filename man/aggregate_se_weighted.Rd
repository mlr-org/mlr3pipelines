\title{Aggregate SEs from multiple learners with weights.}
\usage{
aggregate_se_weighted(
  means_list,
  ses_list = NULL,
  weights,
  method = "none",
  rho = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{means_list}{list of numeric vectors (length N), per-model mean predictions.}

\item{ses_list}{NULL or list of numeric vectors (length N), per-model SEs.
If non-NULL, must have same length and alignment as means_list.}

\item{weights}{numeric vector of length K summing to 1 (checked elsewhere).}

\item{method}{one of "none", "predictive", "mean", "within", "between".}

\item{rho}{numeric scalar for "mean" method; equicorrelation parameter.
Will be clamped to \link{-1/(K-1), 1} if K > 1; ignored otherwise.}
}
\value{
numeric vector (length N) of aggregated SEs, or \code{NULL} if \code{method = "none"}.
}
